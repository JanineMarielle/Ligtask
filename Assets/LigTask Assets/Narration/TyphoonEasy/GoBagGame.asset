  - A typhoon is a powerful tropical cyclone that can bring extreme winds, heavy
    rain, storm surges, and flooding.
  - In the Philippines, typhoon season usually lasts from June to November, but storms
    can happen anytime.
  - Typhoons can cause damage to homes, power outages, and life-threatening conditions.
    Preparing before the storm, staying safe during, and avoiding hazards after are
    essential for survival.
  - "The news just said a strong typhoon is heading our way. We need to pack our
    Go Bag right now so we\u2019re ready if we have to evacuate. "
  - "Items will slide onto the screen. If the item is necessary, slide it down into
    your Go Bag. If not, slide it up to discard it. \r\n"
  - Time limits get shorter at higher difficulty and some rounds may have a mix of
    necessary and unnecessary items, choose quickly!
