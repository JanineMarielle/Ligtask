  - Volcanic ash can get into your lungs and damage your house. Keep it out to stay
    safe.
  - Seal all windows with plastic and tape, and block doors with damp rags or towels
    when there's ashfall.
  - This stops ash from entering, protecting your health and keeping your home clean
    during the eruption.
