  - Heavy rains can loosen the soil on hills and mountains, but trees help keep the
    ground firm with their roots.
  - Your goal is to test the soil and plant trees in the right spots to make the
    slope stable.
  - "If the water drains too fast, the soil is too loose. If it drains at a steady
    pace, it\u2019s good for planting, but if it takes too long, the soil is too
    hard for trees to grow well."
  - You can also track the clock! The soil is perfect if the water drains in 2 to
    6 hours.
