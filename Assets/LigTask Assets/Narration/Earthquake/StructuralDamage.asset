  - After an earthquake, buildings might look fine on the outside but some could
    be unsafe.
  - For this level, check for structural damage by finding cracks on the walls and
    rooms.
  - These cracks can weaken walls or foundations and if ignored, they might cause
    collapse later.
  - Tap on every crack you can find before time runs out. Some may be small, so stay
    alert!
