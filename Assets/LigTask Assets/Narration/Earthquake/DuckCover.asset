  - Duck, Cover, Hold is the recommended safety action during an earthquake to protect
    yourself from falling objects and debris.
  - Tap once to duck under the table, then hold your finger on the screen until the
    shaking stops.
  - "Remember, if you don't hold on the screen on time or let go too early you\u2019ll
    lose points!"
  - When the shaking stops, swipe right to move towards the exit. Time to focus!
